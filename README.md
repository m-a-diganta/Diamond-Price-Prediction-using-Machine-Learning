<h1>Project: Diamond Price Prediction using Machine Learning [CSE437]</h1>
<section>
    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset contains various features of diamonds such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and price. Before training the models, the dataset was cleaned, preprocessed, and split into training and testing sets.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Machine Learning Models</h2>
    <p>The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linear Regression</li>
        <li>Decision Tree Regression</li>
        <li>Random Forest Regression</li>
        <li>Gradient Boosting Regression</li>
        <li>Support Vector Regression (SVR)</li>
        <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Model Selection</h2>
    <p>After evaluating the performance of each model, Random Forest Regression was selected.</p>
    <p>To further improve the performance of the Random Forest model, hyperparameter tuning has been performed.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Explainable AI (XAI)</h2>
    <p>Explainable AI (XAI) techniques were applied to interpret and explain the predictions. The following XAI models were used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lime</li>
        <li>ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The results of the model evaluation and explanation are visible in the Colab file.</p>
